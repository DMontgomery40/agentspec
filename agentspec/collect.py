    - For `import` statements, extracts the module name directly from the alias
    - For `from...import` statements, constructs the full import path by joining the source module with the imported name using dot notation, handling cases where the module is None (bare `from ... import`)
    - Deduplicates the collected imports by converting to a set, filters out empty strings, and returns a sorted list for consistent ordering
    - Returns an empty list if the AST has no body or contains no import statements

    - Uses getattr with a default empty list to safely access the body attribute, preventing AttributeError if the AST node lacks a body (defensive programming)
    - Checks isinstance for both ast.Import and ast.ImportFrom separately because they have different structures: Import has a flat names list, while ImportFrom has both a module and a names list
    - Constructs full import paths for ImportFrom by joining module and alias name with dots, which provides more granular dependency information than just the module name
    - Handles the edge case where ImportFrom.module is None (occurs with relative imports like `from . import foo`) by using `or ""` and filtering empty parts
    - Deduplicates using set comprehension before sorting to ensure O(n log n) performance and eliminate redundant entries that might arise from multiple import statements importing the same module
    - Returns sorted output for deterministic, reproducible results across runs, which is critical for consistent dependency tracking and agent analysis

    - ALWAYS maintain the getattr fallback to [] for safety when tree.body is missing
    - ALWAYS return a List[str] type as specified in the type hint

def collect_metadata(filepath: Path, func_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    '''
    ```python
    """
    Extracts deterministic metadata (function calls, imports, git history) from a Python function via AST parsing and git log.

    WHAT:
    - Parses Python file AST to locate target function (sync or async) and extracts internal calls and module imports
    - Retrieves function-specific git history using `git log -L :func_name:filepath` (up to 5 most recent commits), filtering to commit message lines only
    - Returns `{"deps": {"calls": [...], "imports": [...]}, "changelog": [...]}` on success; empty dict `{}` on any failure (function not found, parse error, exception)
    - Edge cases: First AST match used if function name collides; git unavailable defaults changelog to `["- no git history available"]`; no commits found defaults to `["- none yet"]`

    WHY:
    - AST-based parsing provides syntactically-aware function identification, avoiding false positives from strings/comments
    - Git `-L` option provides function-specific history without manual line tracking; automatically handles boundary changes across commits
    - Fail-closed exception handling (return `{}`) ensures agent pipelines never crash; metadata collection is non-critical and degrades gracefully
    - Separate try-except for git allows partial metadata return (deps without changelog) if git fails

    GUARDRAILS:
    - DO NOT raise exceptions instead of returning `{}`; breaks fail-closed contract required by agent pipelines
    - DO NOT remove `errors="ignore"` from `.decode()` without handling git output encoding edge cases
    - DO NOT modify git command structure; `-L :func_name:filepath` syntax is required for accurate line-range filtering
    - DO NOT recursively analyze imported modules or follow call chains; keep analysis local and deterministic
    - ALWAYS preserve distinction between `ast.FunctionDef` and `ast.AsyncFunctionDef` to support both sync and async functions
    - ALWAYS strip whitespace from changelog lines to avoid formatting artifacts
    - ALWAYS filter git output to only lines matching commit format (starts with `"- YYYY-MM-DD:"` and contains hash in parentheses)

    CHANGELOG (from git history):
    - 2025-10-30: feat: enhance CLI help and add rich formatting support
    - Parses a Python file using the `ast` module to locate a target function by name (supporting both sync and async function definitions)
    - Extracts two categories of deterministic metadata: (1) `deps.calls` containing all function calls made within the target function via `_get_function_calls()`, and (2) `deps.imports` containing all module-level imports in the file via `_get_module_imports()`
    - Attempts to retrieve git changelog history specific to the target function using `git log -L` with line-range filtering, capturing up to 5 most recent commits with short dates and commit messages
    - Returns a dictionary with structure `{"deps": {"calls": [...], "imports": [...]}, "changelog": [...]}` on success, or an empty dict `{}` if the function cannot be found, parsing fails, or any exception occurs during metadata collection
    - Gracefully degrades: if git history is unavailable, changelog defaults to `["- no git history available"]`; if no commits are found, defaults to `["- none yet"]`
    - Called by: [Inferred to be called by documentation generation or agent analysis pipelines that need to understand function dependencies]
    - Calls: `_get_function_calls()` [extracts function call names from AST node], `_get_module_imports()` [extracts top-level import statements], `ast.parse()` [parses Python source into AST], `ast.walk()` [traverses AST nodes], `filepath.read_text()` [reads file content], `subprocess.check_output()` [executes git log command], `isinstance()` [type checking for FunctionDef/AsyncFunctionDef], `str.strip()` [whitespace cleanup], `str.splitlines()` [line splitting], `str.decode()` [bytes to string conversion]
    - Imports used: `__future__.annotations` [enables postponed evaluation of type hints], `ast` [abstract syntax tree parsing], `pathlib.Path` [filesystem path handling], `subprocess` [external process execution], `typing.Any` [generic type annotation], `typing.Dict` [dictionary type annotation], `typing.List` [list type annotation]
    - External services: Git command-line tool (required for changelog generation; gracefully fails if unavailable)
    - AST-based parsing was chosen over regex or string matching because it provides accurate, syntactically-aware identification of function definitions and their internal calls, avoiding false positives from comments, strings, or nested scopes
    - The `ast.walk()` approach iterates through all nodes rather than using a visitor pattern because it is simpler for one-off lookups and the performance cost is negligible for typical file sizes
    - Git's `-L` option (line-range filtering) was selected over parsing all commits because it provides function-specific history without requiring manual line number tracking or heuristic-based filtering
    - Fail-closed exception handling (returning `{}` on any error) was chosen to ensure the function never crashes the calling agent; metadata collection is non-critical and should degrade gracefully
    - The `errors="ignore"` parameter in `.decode()` prevents UnicodeDecodeError from malformed git output, prioritizing robustness over strict validation
    - Separate try-except blocks for git operations allow the function to return partial metadata (deps without changelog) if git fails, rather than losing all data
    - The function does NOT recursively analyze imported modules or follow call chains, keeping analysis local and deterministic
    - Current implementation: Parses Python AST to extract function metadata (calls and imports) and augments with git commit history using line-range filtering, with graceful degradation on parsing or git failures.
    - DO NOT modify the exception handling to raise errors instead of returning `{}`; this breaks the fail-closed contract
    - DO NOT remove the `errors="ignore"` parameter from `.decode()` without understanding git output encoding edge cases
    - DO NOT change the git command structure without verifying that `-L :func_name:filepath` syntax is preserved for accurate line-range filtering
    - DO NOT assume `_get_function_calls()` or `_get_module_imports()` are available; verify they exist in the same module
    - ALWAYS preserve the distinction between `ast.FunctionDef` and `ast.AsyncFunctionDef` to support both sync and async functions
    - ALWAYS return an empty dict on failure rather than raising exceptions, to maintain compatibility with agent pipelines
    - ALWAYS strip whitespace from changelog lines to avoid formatting artifacts
    - NOTE: This function depends on external git availability; it will silently degrade if git is not installed or the filepath is not in a git repository
    - NOTE: The `-n5` limit on git log means only the 5 most recent commits are captured; older history is discarded
    - NOTE: If a function name appears multiple times in a file (e.g., in different scopes), only the first match via `ast.walk()` is used; this may not be the intended function if there are name collisions
